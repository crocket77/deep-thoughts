install:
npm install jsonwebtoken
npm i @apollo/client graphql


Apollo Client (@apollo/client) is an all-in-one dependency that enables us to connect to a GraphQL API server and execute queries or mutations using their own special form of React Hooks.
GraphQL (graphql) is a dependency much like MySQL2 was for Sequelize. We don't use it directly, but it needs to be present so that the GraphQL syntax used with Apollo Client can be understood.
